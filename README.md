* Complete the activity below.
* Push your solution to your forked repo
* Submit a pull request from your repository to this repository
  * Put your name in your PR!
  * Indicate which Iteration you have _completed_.

## Iteration 1

Use TDD to build an `Ingredient` class with the following attributes:

* `name` - the name of the ingredient
* `unit` - the unit in which the ingredient is measured
* `calories` - the amount of calories per unit of the ingredient.
## Iteration 2

Use TDD to build a `Recipe` class that responds to the following:

* The recipe should have a name and way to read that data.
* The recipe should be able to add ingredients and quantity needed for the recipe. Use the method name `add_ingredient` and have it take 2 arguments.
* The recipe should be able to list all of its ingredients.
* The recipe should be able to check the quantity needed of a given ingredient to make that recipe.
* The recipe should be able to find the total number of calories in that dish.


## Iteration 3

Use TDD to build a `Pantry` class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/pantry'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/ingredient'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/recipe'
# => true

pry(main)> pantry = Pantry.new
# => #<Pantry:0x007fd8858863b8...>

pry(main)> cheese = Ingredient.new("Cheese", "C", 50)
# => #<Ingredient:0x007fd885846e20...>

pry(main)> mac = Ingredient.new("Macaroni", "oz", 200)
# => #<Ingredient:0x007fd88582ed98...>

pry(main)> mac_and_cheese = Recipe.new("Mac and Cheese")
# => #<Recipe:0x007fd885050fe0...>

pry(main)> mac_and_cheese.add_ingredient(cheese, 2)

pry(main)> mac_and_cheese.add_ingredient(mac, 8)

pry(main)> pantry.stock
# => {}

pry(main)> pantry.stock_check(cheese)
# => 0

pry(main)> pantry.restock(cheese, 5)

pry(main)> pantry.restock(cheese, 10)

pry(main)> pantry.stock_check(cheese)
# => 15

pry(main)> pantry.enough_ingredients_for?(mac_and_cheese)
# => false

pry(main)> pantry.restock(mac, 8)

pry(main)> pantry.enough_ingredients_for?(mac_and_cheese)
# => true
```

## Iteration 4

Use TDD to build a `CookBook` class that responds to the following interaction pattern.

For the `summary`, ingredients are listed in order of calories. This is the amount of calories that ingredient contributes to the total calories of the recipe, not the amount of calories per single unit of the ingredient.

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/cook_book'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/ingredient'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/recipe'
# => true

pry(main)> cookbook = CookBook.new
# => #<CookBook:0x00007faae6a42228 @recipes=[]>

pry(main)> cheese = Ingredient.new("Cheese", "C", 100)
# => #<Ingredient:0x00007faae6a207e0...>

pry(main)> mac = Ingredient.new("Macaroni", "oz", 30)
# => #<Ingredient:0x00007faae69e3cf0...>

pry(main)> mac_and_cheese = Recipe.new("Mac and Cheese")
# => #<Recipe:0x00007faae69c9698...>

pry(main)> mac_and_cheese.add_ingredient(cheese, 2)

pry(main)> mac_and_cheese.add_ingredient(mac, 8)

pry(main)> ground_beef = Ingredient.new("Ground Beef", "oz", 100)
# => #<Ingredient:0x00007faae6950860...>

pry(main)> bun = Ingredient.new("Bun", "g", 1)
# => #<Ingredient:0x00007faae694bb80...>

pry(main)> burger = Recipe.new("Burger")
# => #<Recipe:0x00007faae692a110...>

pry(main)> burger.add_ingredient(ground_beef, 4)

pry(main)> burger.add_ingredient(bun, 100)

pry(main)> cookbook.add_recipe(mac_and_cheese)

pry(main)> cookbook.add_recipe(burger)

pry(main)> cookbook.summary
# => [{:name=>"Mac and Cheese", :details=>{:ingredients=>[{:ingredient=>"Macaroni", :amount=>"8 oz"}, {:ingredient=>"Cheese", :amount=>"2 C"}], :total_calories=>440}}, {:name=>"Burger", :details=>{:ingredients=>[{:ingredient=>"Ground Beef", :amount=>"4 oz"}, {:ingredient=>"Bun", :amount=>"100 g"}], :total_calories=>500}}]
```
